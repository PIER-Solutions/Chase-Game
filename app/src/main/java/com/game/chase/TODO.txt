Things to do in the app:
- Unit tests for UI, ViewModel, Repositories
- Add in a logging wrapper and some useful logging calls
- Break GameInteractor into smaller classes
- Move game logic from interactor into a pure game logic class (com.game.chase.domain.logic.newClass)? Seems excessive for this right now
- Add interfaces for data access
- Add persistence for game state so you can exit & reload from where you left off if the game dies
